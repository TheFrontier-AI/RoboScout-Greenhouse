# Greenhouse tomato problems: visual cues and farmer actions

Canonical keys are used for label normalisation in `SKILL.md` §2. Give the farmer the common local name for
each problem (in their language) next to the English one, and ask them to correct local names. Actions are
cultural or first-response only. For chemicals always say "registered product, follow the label, ask the Thai
Department of Agriculture / local extension". Camera tip = where R1 usually
sees it first.

## Fungal / oomycete
| key | Thai / English | Visual cues (what Cosmos/Nemotron should mention) | Look-alikes | Camera tip | Farmer action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `early_blight` | Early blight (*Alternaria*) | brown spots with **concentric rings** (target), yellow halo, older lower leaves first; dark collar lesion on stem; fruit spots at stem end | septoria, bacterial spot, K deficiency | `low` | remove lower infected leaves, avoid wetting leaves, improve airflow, mulch/clean floor; fungicide per label |
| `late_blight` | Late blight (*Phytophthora infestans*) | large **dark, greasy, water-soaked** patches, often at leaf edge; **white downy growth on underside** in humid mornings; brown firm fruit rot; stem lesions | gray mold, frost/chemical burn | any | **urgent**, spreads in days: inspect neighbours today, bag and remove infected plants, cut humidity/leaf wetness, ventilate; extension officer |
| `leaf_mold` | Leaf mold (*Passalora fulva*) | pale green-yellow diffuse spots on **upper** surface; **olive-green to brown velvet** under the leaf; humid houses (RH > 85 %) | powdery mildew (L. taurica), Mg deficiency | `low`/`mid` | lower humidity, prune for airflow, remove infected leaves; resistant varieties next crop |
| `septoria` | Septoria leaf spot | many **small round spots (1.5–3 mm)**, grey/tan centre, dark border, tiny **black dots** (pycnidia) in centre; lower leaves | early blight (larger, ringed), bacterial spot | `low` | remove lower leaves, avoid splash, sanitation |
| `powdery_mildew` | Powdery mildew (*Oidium neolycopersici*, *Leveillula taurica*) | **white powdery patches** on upper leaf (Oidium); or yellow blotches above with faint white growth below (Leveillula) | leaf mold, spray residue, dust | `mid`/`high` | remove badly affected leaves, keep RH stable, fungicide per label |
| `gray_mold` | Gray mold (*Botrytis*) | **grey fuzzy mould** on wounds, leaf-axils, stems, flowers, fruit; tan stem lesions | late blight | `low`/`mid` | remove debris and infected tissue, ventilate, clean pruning cuts |

## Bacterial / viral
| key | Thai / English | Visual cues | Look-alikes | Camera tip | Farmer action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bacterial_spot` | Bacterial spot (*Xanthomonas*) | small (< 3 mm) **dark, greasy, angular** spots, may have yellow halo, merge into blight; raised **scabby** fruit spots | septoria, early blight | `low`/`mid` | **lab confirm**; remove infected plants, disinfect tools/hands, avoid working when wet; copper products per label (resistance common) |
| `tylcv` | Yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV and related begomoviruses, common in Thailand) | young leaves **small, cupped upward, yellow margins**, plant stunted and bushy, flowers drop; whiteflies present | Mg/N deficiency, herbicide damage, mites | `high` | **lab confirm (PCR)**; no cure: rogue (remove) infected plants in a bag, control **whitefly**, insect-proof screens, resistant varieties |

## Nutrient / physiological
| key | Thai / English | Visual cues | Camera tip | Farmer action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `def_nitrogen` | N deficiency | uniform pale yellowing of **older** leaves, thin stems | `low` | check fertigation EC/recipe; leaf/tissue test |
| `def_magnesium` | Mg deficiency | **interveinal** yellowing of **older** leaves, veins stay green (very common in greenhouse tomato) | `low`/`mid` | check Mg in feed and K:Mg balance; tissue test |
| `def_potassium` | K deficiency | **leaf-edge scorch** (brown margins) on older leaves; blotchy/uneven ripening | `low`/`mid` | check K in feed; tissue test |
| `def_iron` | Fe deficiency | interveinal chlorosis of **young** leaves; often high pH or wet roots | `high` | check pH of feed/substrate, drainage |
| `blossom_end_rot` | Blossom-end rot (Ca transport) | dark sunken leathery patch at **fruit bottom** | fruit zone | steady watering, avoid drought/salt stress, check Ca and EC; not infectious |
| `water_stress` | Water stress / wilting | wilting in the morning, leaf roll, dry substrate; may be one plant (clogged dripper) | any | check dripper/line at that plant; see `greenhouse-watering` |

## Pests
| key | Thai / English | Visual cues | Farmer action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `whitefly` | Whitefly | tiny white flying insects under leaves, honeydew, black **sooty mould**; vector of TYLCV | yellow sticky traps, screens, biological/registered control; urgent if TYLCV seen |
| `thrips` | Thrips | **silvery** stippling/streaks, black specks; vector of tospoviruses | blue sticky traps, remove weeds, registered control |
| `spider_mites` | Spider mites | fine yellow **stippling**, bronzing, **fine webbing**; worse in hot dry spots | raise humidity locally, predatory mites, registered miticide |
| `leaf_miner` | Leaf miner (*Liriomyza*, *Tuta absoluta*) | **serpentine** tunnels (Liriomyza) or **blotch** mines with frass, holes in fruit (Tuta) | remove mined leaves, pheromone traps for Tuta, report Tuta to extension |
| `aphids` | Aphids | clusters on young shoots, curled leaves, honeydew | natural enemies, registered control |
| `caterpillar` | Caterpillars | chewed holes, frass, larvae visible | hand-remove, Bt products per label |

## Confidence notes
- Mites (~0.5 mm) and young whitefly nymphs are near the camera's resolution limit. Report them as "possible,
  check by hand with a lens".
- Virus vs nutrient vs herbicide look very alike on images. Never mark `tylcv` as `confirmed` without
  whitefly evidence plus a farmer check. Recommend a lab test.
- Late blight vs gray mold vs leaf mold need an underside view. The R1 cameras see mostly upper surfaces, so
  ask the farmer to turn a leaf.
